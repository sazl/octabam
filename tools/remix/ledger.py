"""Cross-module resource collisions, caught before a byte is written.

The build refuses to start when two selected modules claim the same
resource, and says which two.

Checked, and how it knows:

  DSP priority       declared (DspSection.priority). Two sections on one
                     priority and one payload are packed in the remix's
                     module order; the number must say it.
  fx2 ids            declared. Two modules on one id would overwrite each
                     other's descriptor and dispatch.
  declared conflicts declared (Module.conflicts). Two modules that touch no
                     common byte but must not share an image.
  fixed-address      declared. Every byte span a module rewrites at a fixed
  writes             address -- pinned caves, cave hooks and detours (their
                     whole written span: hook_stock, pad_to), table refs,
                     symbol refs, plain pokes and emit() pokes -- against
                     every other module's. Two
                     hooks on one instruction: the second jsr overwrites the
                     first and the first never runs; two pokes on one word:
                     the build's second expect assert fails.
  kept bytes         declared (Module.keeps). Stock bytes a module relies on
                     and does not write, against every other module's
                     writes; two keepers must expect the same stock.
  grown tables       declared (TableGrow). Two modules relocating one stock
                     array would each carry a copy, and the refs disagree.
  overrides          a bridge's claim stands in for the overridden module's
                     at that site; a bridge naming a module the remix does
                     not carry is refused.
  DSP hook sites     declared (DspSection.hooks), per payload (DspHook.site
                     may differ per payload). Two hooks whose two-word jsr
                     spans share a stock P word on one payload: the second
                     jsr overwrites the first.
  on-chip SRAM       declared (Claims.sram). A DMA engine's descriptors and
                     buffers there; two modules on one window corrupt each
                     other's transfers.
  core-private Y     derived by scanning the module's source for `y:>$09xx`.
                     Low Y is per core, not per instance, so every effect
                     sharing a core shares these words.
  stock buffers      declared (Claims.stock_instance_buffer). A stock effect
                     that takes an instance buffer from the host's bump
                     allocator gets a per-track base -- the addresses
                     BusVerb and BusDelay hardcode -- and the chooser
                     is one list for all eight tracks, so the build cannot
                     know which track it lands on. Refused beside any module
                     with fixed Y buffers.
  DSP data ranges    declared (Claims.dsp_ranges), per payload below the
                     shared window and across both cores inside it (X, Y
                     and P alias there), against every other module's
                     ranges, FX2 buffer region and core-private Y words,
                     the bus scratch Y:0x36000-0x361FF (bus participants
                     share it by protocol), stock's per-frame staging
                     0x30000-0x30047 and stock's core 1 -> core 0 mailbox
                     0x37F00-0x37F0F. verify_set measures the shared
                     window's writes under the port and holds them to these
                     (tools/remix/dsp_ranges.py).
  arena reserve      the platform's pages must leave the unit sample memory.

Derived beats declared where possible: a scan cannot go stale. Its limit is
that it sees only what the code references, so a word a module means to
reserve but does not yet touch is declared (Claims.reserved_private_y).

Not checked: the P donor region, where placement refuses to overrun,
exactly; writes the build itself makes (menu clones, label caves, arena
literals), which the build's final Keep assert covers.
