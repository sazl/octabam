# `cyan` rendered #00ffff, `yellow` #ffff00 -- because Rich resolves a name

# "it wears your palette" reasoning was simply wrong. Against a warm dark
# background that read as a wall of electric blue. These are gruvbox's own
# tones instead: same three axes, desaturated, and chosen to sit on a dark
# ground rather than shout off it.
#
# WHERE colour goes matters as much as which. The knob bars are twelve rows
# deep, so ONE tint across them made the accent the largest thing on screen
# and said nothing -- but neutralising them entirely went too far the other

[bold]CHOOSERS[/] is the image you are composing — the unit's two effect menus, FX1 above FX2, each in the row order the panel will show. [bold]UNIT[/] follows the cursor — the selected effect's knobs, what it costs, and `r` to hear it on the SOURCE wav.

The loop is one move long: highlight one of yours in AVAILABLE and press `enter`. The image rebuilds and re-boots by itself, so the panel on the right is never showing something else.

[bold]keys[/]
  tab  next pane           up/down (j/k)  move the cursor

          CHOOSERS: remove the row you are on, from ITS list.

               CHOOSERS: move the row within its own chooser

  ?  this              esc  stop audio      q  quit

[bold]two slots, two chooser lists[/]
Every track has TWO effect slots — FX1 then FX2, in that order through the audio — and each has its own chooser list. The middle pane holds BOTH, stacked, and every gesture applies to the list you are standing in: `enter` removes from it, `←→` reorders within it (a row cannot cross from one list to the other by being nudged off the end), and `1` puts the highlighted effect on FX1 or takes it off.

They start from opposite places, and that is the only asymmetry left:

  [bold]FX2[/] is built from nothing. Every row on it is one this remix listed.
  [bold]FX1[/] starts as the ten stock ships, because that is what the box does. Drop them, reorder them, add yours.

Both are then equally yours. Leaving an effect off a chooser takes that ROW and nothing else — its code, descriptor and dispatch stay stock, so an old project that selects it still runs it, and dropping FLANGER from FX1 does not touch its FX2 row.

`p` → FX1 draws the chooser you composed, as the firmware draws it.

[bold]the no-flash gate[/]
The CHOOSERS line ends in `boots` when the built image reaches the RTOS handoff in the local ColdFire emulator. That is the whole of it: a cave that breaks early init faults there instead of on your unit. It is a fact about the IMAGE, so it is on the image's line.

If a selection ever patches the unit's top-level menu, the MAIN MENU appears under CHOOSERS as the firmware draws it. None do yet — a selection changes it only by writing the tables at `0x400cbc00` and every remix so far changes zero bytes of them.

⚠️ There used to be a per-effect block here showing the firmware's own draw of the page. It is gone (3 Sep 2026) and the reason is worth knowing: the rows above already list every drawn parameter with its page number, from the same descriptor, so the picture said it again — and a picture of that screen is not even possible, because the chooser list and the parameter block are two overlaid windows whose coordinates are not comparable. What it was really being squinted at for is whether the descriptor the build WROTE matches the manifest that asked for it: a clone inherits its donor's name fields and slot names, so it can carry the right count, default and enable bit and still be labelled as the effect it was copied from. That is a CHECK, and it now lives in `verify_menu`, where a mismatch fails `make check` instead of having to be noticed in the corner of a pane.

[bold]what an FX1 row costs[/]
No words: the DSP dispatch table is indexed by the raw id and shared by both menus, so an effect's code already ran from FX1 the moment FX1 selected its id. It costs CYCLES — FX1 is four more slots on the same four tracks, so an effect on both menus can double the worst per-core load; watch the Budget's `cycles` row.

Only a buffer-free INSERT of ours, or one whose buffer is declared to fit an FX1 slot, can take one, and the UNIT pane says which cannot and why: an FX1 buffer slot is 3,072 words against FX2's 16,384, a module with fixed FX2 buffers would write into another track's, and a bus server is one per core. The same reasons are why stock keeps DELAY and the three reverbs off FX1 — they do not fit either. An FX1-ONLY module (it passes dry on FX2) says so on its resource line.

⚠️ The firmware's own NONE is always FX1 row 0 and is not shown here: it is how the slot is turned off, and no remix can lose it.

The `FX1+FX2` column in the library says which menus an effect CAN appear on, not where its rows are today; the ✓ beside it is what says whether it is in the image.

It costs no words. The DSP dispatch table is indexed by the raw id and shared by both menus, so the code already ran from FX1 the moment FX1 selected the id; what `1` adds is the panel side. What it DOES cost is cycles: FX1 is four more slots on the same four tracks, so an effect on both menus can double the worst per-core load — watch the Budget's `cycles` row.

Only a buffer-free INSERT, or one whose buffer is declared to fit an FX1 slot, can take one, and the UNIT pane says which cannot and why: an FX1 buffer slot is 3,072 words against FX2's 16,384, a module with fixed FX2 buffers would write into another track's, and a bus server is one per core. An effect that replaces a stock one is listed here by its own name; with FX1 left stock it inherits that effect's row.

[bold]a narrow terminal shows fewer panes[/]
Under 118 columns the panes come in pairs that slide with the focus; under 92, one at a time. The tab bar at the top names all three and marks where you are. Lists longer than the pane scroll with the cursor and say so (`↑ 6 more`).

[bold]what is actually scarce[/]
Every row says what it IS in a column of its own, and under them is a MAP of the payload's effect code, drawn to scale from the real spans: thirteen segments, one per stock effect, `─` for the ones this selection keeps, `.` for the harvested run and `#` for how far your code reached into it. One bar per payload, because the layout is identical in both and only the fill differs. That is the picture the twenty-glyph `words` bar could not draw — it needed a legend and still said neither WHERE in the payload the region is nor WHICH effects it costs, and once the region became a choice those were the only two questions.

Five things, and the Budget strip is one row for each: the two donor regions of 2,724 words (one per payload, and only YOUR modules spend them), the FX2 buffer slots (one per track, per core), the per-core CYCLES, the 31 chooser rows, and the ColdFire cave. Every row reads the same way — [bold]N free of TOTAL, and what took the rest[/].

CYCLES is the one that does not fail as a refusal. Over budget the DSP does not decline to build, it wedges — so the row prices the WORST core under the worst mix this selection allows, which for a card of inserts is four copies of the dearest one: nothing stops all four tracks selecting it. The budget of 3,120 is what our code may spend after stock's own share, measured 23 Aug 2026, and the count is a floor: exact for the code, optimistic about memory contention.

Rows are NOT the scarce thing, which is why `enter` adds rather than swaps: 31 rows fit, and leaving a stock effect out takes its chooser row and nothing else — an old project that selects it still runs it.

THE DONOR REGION IS NOT A PLACE, IT IS A CHOICE. The thirteen DSP effects are laid out CONTIGUOUSLY in 6,158 words (`P:0x007d1..0x01fdf`, no other module between them, measured 3 Sep 2026), and every one is SELF-CONTAINED — no control flow leaves its own span and nothing enters it but its own dispatch entry. So ANY of them can be given up, and its words become ground your modules are placed into. The three reverbs are only the DEFAULT: they are the biggest and FX2-only, so taking them costs FX1 nothing.

Taking an effect off ONE menu costs it only its row there — an old project that selects it still runs it. Taking it off BOTH is the decision to give up its words, and then it really is gone: its dispatch goes to the null stub wherever your code reached it.

⚠️ A GAP IS A WALL. What you gave up becomes one or more contiguous RUNS, and a module is one code stream, so it must fit inside a SINGLE run — 3,880 words spread over three runs will not take a 3,500-word module. That is why the Budget names the largest opening beside the total, and why the map draws a bracket per run rather than one across the stock effects between them. Harvesting an effect that sits BETWEEN two runs joins them into one.

[bold]on an unmodified unit every word is allocated[/]
All 6,158 words of the payload's effect code belong to a stock effect that is using them, and the remixer opens saying exactly that: `no region — every word is a stock effect's`, the map all `─`. NOTHING is set aside for you until you decide what to give up.

[bold]taking an effect off BOTH menus is that decision[/]
There is no separate harvest gesture, because there was never a separate choice: an effect on neither chooser is one you do not want, so its words are where your modules go. `⌁` marks it in the library. That is derived from the two lists, not a third thing to manage — and it reproduces what the build has always done, because FX1 lists ten of the thirteen and the reverbs are FX2-only, so a remix listing none of them on FX2 gives up exactly those three.

Add a module before giving anything up and the ⚠ says so, with `x` dropping the three reverbs — the biggest, and FX2-only, so they cost FX1 nothing.

⚠️ BOTH menus. An effect off FX2 but still on FX1 is still wanted, and the DSP dispatch is one table shared by them, so overwriting its code would take it off FX1 too. Removing it says which: `still on FX1, so its 329 words stay its own` or `off both menus now, so its 329 words join the region`.

⚠️ THE TWO LISTS STAY INDEPENDENT, and they have to. "Off one is off both" would be simpler to operate and would make the plain `bus` remix impossible: its FX2 chooser is BusVerb, BusDelay and Send, so every stock effect is off FX2 — and taking them off FX1 with it would leave the unit with NO FX1 EFFECTS AT ALL and hand your modules all 6,158 words they did not ask for.

⚠️ AND IT ONLY COSTS WHERE YOUR CODE REACHES. What you gave up becomes one or more unbroken RUNS, and each module is packed into a run it fits, from that run's lowest address; anything the placer never reaches keeps its algorithm and its dispatch and simply has no chooser row — which is exactly what unlisting a stock effect has always done. A module is one code stream, so it must fit inside a SINGLE run: two runs of 1,500 words will not take a 2,000-word module, and the budget says the largest opening for that reason.

[bold]a reverb you keep listed is spending words[/]
PLATE, SPRING and DARK REV's code IS the donor region, so the `held by` line is the live trade: what they are holding, and what dropping the next one buys. The region packs from PLATE upward, so holding a LOW reverb also makes the space above it unreachable — keeping PLATE alone leaves 2,130 words by size and 0 you can actually place.

You CAN keep them. The build takes only the reverbs your modules actually reach, and the pane says which went (`— Plate Rev  donor, taken`). (Until 2 Sep 2026 all three were nulled unconditionally and the honest answer here was "you cannot, ever". That is no longer true.)

[bold]there is one FX2 buffer per track[/]
"Free" there means "no module has pinned it", not "unused": a track whose buffer no module claims still HAS that buffer, ready for whatever is selected on it. Only a MODULE claims one for the life of the image. BusVerb holds all four of its core's, BusDelay two of its core's — and they go in PAIRS, so "4 free" is two pairs, not four independent slots.

A stock effect never appears in that row: it takes a slot from the allocator at runtime, per effect per block, only while it is selected on that track — which no image can reserve. That runtime contest is why the ledger refuses an allocating stock effect beside a pinner, and it is what the ⚠ is asking you to remove. FLANGER, CHORUS, SPATIALIZER and COMB FILTER keep their FX1 rows and still work; the three reverbs were FX2-only in stock and are lost outright.

[bold]A / B compares two EFFECTS[/]
Not two renders ago against now. `r` to hear one, `a` to park it, point at the rival, `b` — which re-renders it on the SAME source — then `,` and `.` to flip. That is the question a remixer exists to answer: is mine better than the one the box came with?

[bold]why an effect can render DRY[/]
Six of the eleven stock effects ship with their wet control at zero — PHASER, FLANGER, CHORUS and COMB (MIX), SPATIALIZER and DELAY (SEND) — so `r` on one at its defaults plays the source back unchanged. That is faithful: the defaults are read from the firmware's own descriptor. The UNIT pane says `⚠ MIX is 0 — this renders DRY` when it applies.

[bold]the fallback[/]
An id the image does not implement aliases to the FALLBACK — normally SEND, so an old project degrades to a send rather than to noise. It is added for you the moment a selection needs one; `f` chooses another; `◀fb` marks it. A stock chooser with no modules of ours cannot build for exactly this reason: it has no fallback to name, and no stock effect is a safe one.""",

        something you inferred from a refusal. Four scarce things, and only

        buffer line said "5,6,7,8 keep theirs" with neither. Three different
        answers to one question is what made it unreadable.
