"""Discovery of remix modules: the index.

Every directory under `modules/` holding a `manifest.py` that exports a
`MODULE` is a contribution; there is no central list. The registry refuses
duplicate keys and ids. Directories whose name starts with `_` or `.` are
skipped (`modules/_template/`).

The stock FX2 effects (tools/remix/stock.py) are registered alongside under
their own keys ("FILTER", "CHORUS", ...), so a remix keeps one in the
chooser by listing it as it lists a module. They are Kind.STOCK: no code,
no clone, no words; the build writes only their chooser row.
