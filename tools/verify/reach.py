"""Which gates a change reaches, in two tiers.

QUICK (the default, 29 Sep 2026) is for working: a module change checks the
remixes carrying it that users flash (remixes/), or, when only test remixes
carry it, the smallest of those; the floor for tool and build changes is
the one cover remix carrying the most modules; a build change runs refhash
but not `make identity` (every remix built twice); no `make accept` (the
stress fixture and the pressure stages); two shards; every command at
nice 10 on the performance cores, so the machine stays usable.
FULL (`make reach FULL=1`, `--full`) is everything below, at full speed, and
only ever a manual choice.

Which gates a change reaches: the diff against main, classified by what
depends on each changed file.

    python3 tools/verify/reach.py [--base origin/main] [--run] [--paths ...]
    make reach [BASE=origin/main] [RUN=1] [KEEP=1] [JOBS=n]

CONTRIBUTING's "every remix the change can reach" was worked out by hand:
a module's remixes from the selections, a build change's refhash, a
verifier's callers. This reads the changed paths (committed and not,
against the merge-base with `--base`) and prints the commands, one line
each, with the paths that put them there; `--run` runs them in order and
stops at the first failure (`--keep-going`: every one, then a table).
There is no default remix. The FLOOR -- what a change to the build, the
port, a shared tool or an unclassified path reaches -- is the COVER: the
fewest remixes that between them carry every module (greedy from the
registry, 9 of 27 on 28 Sep 2026), so every module's gates and every kind
of per-remix gate run at least once. `--all` makes it every remix. A
change to the BUILD adds `image_identity.py`: every remix built from the
base and from this tree, and `--run` then checks the ones whose image
moved (dry mode says so). Together with refhash (the flag matrix of one
layout) that replaces "every remix" for a build change; before 28 Sep
2026 every such change ran all 25-27 remixes' checks.

HOW A PATH IS PLACED (28 Sep 2026; before, by directory):

  modules/<name>/           the remixes carrying the module: make check (both
                            halves) and make accept for each
  remixes/<name>/remix.py   that remix (remixes/test/<name>/remix.py too)
  tools/, scripts/          by DEPENDENCY: the Python imports (`from remix
                            import`, `import send_probe`) and the
                            `tools/x/y.py` path strings in every tools/ file
                            are a graph; a changed file reaches the gates
                            that transitively depend on it --
                              the build (build_bus.py, cycle_count.py, dsp/)
                                -> refhash, identity (then the changed remixes'
                                   checks), the runner tests, check-shared once
                                   for the cover
                              a gate of the SHARED half (the verify-shared
                              recipe: selftest, slots, replaces, docs,
                              label_fmt, the knob census; a manifest gate
                              with remix_arg=False)
                                -> make check-shared once (for the cover) / its owners
                              a gate of the PER-REMIX half (the verify-remix
                              recipe: dirtystate, initregs, dram_boot, labels,
                              modenames, hidden, menu, set, usb)
                                -> make check-remix for the cover
                              a manifest gate with remix_arg=True
                                -> make check for its owners' remixes
                              the acceptance machinery (acceptance.py,
                              module_gates.py, stress_project.py, pressure.py)
                                -> the runner tests, the cover, accept for the cover
                              a file no gate depends on (bcr2000.py, a render
                              tool a `make render*` target runs)
                                -> nothing, and the note says so
                            tools/emu/ (the port) is the cover's per-remix
                            half plus ci-emu and emu-cf; tools/harness/dsp_host,
                            tools/patches, setup.sh, vendor.sh are ci-dsp
                            plus the cover (identity cannot see a toolchain
                            change: both trees build with the same binary)
  Makefile                  by TARGET: the targets whose recipe or
                            prerequisites changed against the base --
                            the check graph (bus, cycles, verify*, check*)
                            reaches identity, the cover and make ci; the
                            runner's targets (accept, reach, check-remixes,
                            test-acceptance) the runner tests; the ci
                            targets make ci; any other target nothing; a
                            changed variable or define, identity + the cover
  docs/, *.md               verify_docs
  .github/                  make ci
  anything else             the cover, named unclassified

It refuses a tree that is not rebased onto the base (the base must be an
ancestor of HEAD): gates run before a rebase are not a result (PR #396).
CI runs the dry form on every pull request so the expected local gates are
in the job log; it has no firmware, so it runs none of them.

Two or more remixes to check are printed as one `make check-shared
REMIXES="..."` (once) and a `make check-remix REMIX=<r>` each; one remix
alone stays `make check`. `make accept` runs both halves itself (the shared
half once for every remix it is given), so with STRESS_SOURCE set a remix
that reaches accept has no separate check line and the accept remixes are
one `make accept REMIXES="..."`; without it the check lines stay and the
accept line is listed as blocked. `--run --jobs N` runs the check-remix
lines through `check_shards.py`, N worktrees at a time.
