"""Enumerate the image just built as a USB device under the ColdFire port.

Boots out/mainos_bus.bin with the device-controller model and its bench
(tools/emu/ot_emu/usb.h), then acts as the host: bus reset, GET_DESCRIPTOR,
SET_ADDRESS, SET_CONFIGURATION, a mass-storage INQUIRY and TEST UNIT READY
over EP1. The firmware's own USB stack answers every step, so this checks:

  * the stock control path is intact in the built image (a module that
    moves a descriptor table, hooks the ISR or grows a configuration shows
    up here as a wrong VID/PID, a short config or a hang);
  * the model's queue-head and transfer-descriptor walk agrees with what
    the firmware builds (the INQUIRY data + CSW chain, both directions);
  * no primed queue head was left uninitialised (the defect that crashed a
    unit under octemu's USB-audio payload).

SKIPs when the port is not built (`make emu-cf`). What this cannot see:
timing (the port serialises the host's polls against the frame interrupt)
and anything a real host does beyond these requests.
