# The panel: surface, fonts, text and regions (OS 1.40C, MKII)

The experimental [USB panel mirror](USB_PANEL_MIRROR.md) observes accepted
outgoing panel bytes rather than a guessed framebuffer. Its boot capture found
traffic before the DRAM loader: an initialized ROM FIFO guards both accepted
ring commits, then drains in order after the loader before live observation.
The FIFO holds 3072 bytes; both models accepted 2522 early bytes. Separate
MKI/MKII captured runtime UART vectors are byte-identical with capture enabled
or disabled (6919/8156 bytes), with full 128-block LCD coverage;
this does not establish physical timing or audio coexistence. The historical
measurements below remain their original evidence.

Read out of `out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin` (SHA256 `164f3122…`), base
`0x40000400`, on 16 Sep 2026, while chasing why the arranger greys a field
out. This is the part of `MAINMENU.md` section 8's "drawing primitives behind the
state table's draw functions" now read: enough to draw text, boxes and
shading of your own.

Static reading unless marked ✅. The one hardware fact is negative and cost
a flash: the formatting drawer's two spare arguments are **not** a shade
(section 3). `0x40012368` (section 4) was re-read from objdump on 16 Sep, by hand, not
run (🟡 where marked).

---

## 1. The surface — 128 × 64, four grey levels

The descriptor every UI call passes (`0x400bf10a`):

| offset | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+0` | `0x80` | width, 128 |
| `+4` | `0x40` | height, 64 |
| `+8` | `0x02` | **bits per pixel** |
| `+12` | `0x46c7e0ea` | the buffer every drawer writes |
| `+16` | `0x46c7ca38` | a second buffer |
| `+20`, `+24` | `0x90000000`, `0x10004008` | 🟡 unidentified |

Both buffers are 1,024 bytes = 128 × 64 ÷ 8: two 1-bit planes. ✅ `+12`
is the picture, and it is stored a quarter turn round: 64 columns × 128
rows, 8 bytes per row, MSB left, screen pixel (x, y) = column 63−y of row
x (rendered from a port dump under every candidate layout, 17 Sep 2026;
`ot_emu --lcd` + `tools/emu/lcd_view.py`, `tools/emu/README.md`). `+16` read as all
`0xff` after a boot and a load; the UI init at `0x40063264` clears both
with `0x40020950(buf, 0x400)` (a memset — ~~the refresh or DMA setup~~,
retracted 17 Sep) and then fills a 1,024-byte block from `0x40011804`
with `-1`. Every drawing routine below writes only `+12`. What sends the
plane to the panel controller over UART1 (`0xfc064000`; the byte queue is
`0x40010aa4`) is not located.

## 2. Fonts — metrics records, no colour

A font is a 20-byte record. Two are in use:

| | `0x400ba862` | `0x400ba876` |
|---|---|---|
| `+0` default advance | 5 | 3 |
| `+4` `(yOffset << 16) \| height` | `0/5` | `1/6` |
| `+8` | → per-glyph width table | ← |
| `+12` | → per-glyph offset table (signed words; negative = absent) | ← |
| `+16` | → the glyph bitmaps | ← |

Read off the **width-measuring** routine `0x40012f30(font, limit, str)`,
which walks a string adding `+8`'s per-glyph widths, falling back to `+0`
when a glyph has none, and skipping glyphs whose `+12` word is negative.

There is no colour or level anywhere in the record.

Eight such records sit at `0x400ba812 … 0x400ba89e` (nordseele, 22 Sep
2026): `0x400ba876` is the small UI font, 506 literal references in the
image (✅ counted here), `0x400ba83a` a large one (29 references). The two
in the table are the ones the text routines use; the other six are not
decoded.

## 3. Text — one bit, ORed, no intensity

Two entry points, both ultimately the same blitter:

```
0x40013904(font, surface, x, y, a, b, fmt, args…)   printf-style
0x40012bd8(font, surface, x, y, limit, str)         a plain string
```

⚠️ **The `-1` that every call passes is a maximum character count**, not a
shade: the blitter compares it against a character counter at `0x40012cea`
and `0x40012da4`.

The inner loop:

```
40012caa:  mvz.w (%a1)+,%d0      ; a row of glyph bits
40012cb0:  lsr.l %d5,%d0         ; shift to x
40012cb2:  or.l  %d0,(%a0)       ; OR into surface@(12)
```

One bit per pixel, ORed in, always into the same buffer. Text drawing takes
no intensity. ✅ Confirmed negatively on the unit: a probe module
(`ui-dimprobe`, not in this tree) recorded the two spare arguments of
`0x40013904` (`fp@(24)`, `fp@(28)`) and they never varied with what was
dimmed.

### 3b. The SETUP windows' calls, for a page of one's own (nordseele, MKI, 15 Sep 2026)

Run on a MKI by octalab; each entry point re-read here as a function
prologue with the reference count shown ✅. `0x4005829c(115, 64, 0, 0, 1,
closed)` the window; `0x400125ac(surface, 0, 1)` its planes cleared as the
SETUP windows do; `0x400570b8(object, title, "")` the frame and title band
(5 refs); `0x40011b94(surface, x, y0, y1, 1)` a solid vertical line;
`0x40011a58(surface, x0, y, x1)` a dotted horizontal line, one pixel in
two (26 refs); `0x40012004(surface, x0, y0, x1, y1, 1)` a line drawn pixel
by pixel with the ink toggling (15 refs); `0x40013904(font, surface, x, y,
align, invert, width, fmt, …)` formatted text, align 1 centred / 2 right,
its box cleared first, `width` a template string sizing the box (the
stock's `"XXXX"` at `0x400b451d`) (128 refs). Not reconciled: section 3 reads
`0x40013904` as `(font, surface, x, y, a, b, fmt, args…)`, six fixed
arguments before `fmt`; nordseele's read has seven. The stock example is
EFFECT 1 SETUP (opener `FUN_40059afc`, descriptor `0x400bc25a`, draw
`FUN_4003792c`): a solid line at x `0x34`, dotted verticals at `0x48` and
`0x5c`, a dotted horizontal at y `0x1c`, 20-px cells, labels centred at x
`col·0x14 + 0x3e`, y `0x30 − row·0x1b`; y runs up from the bottom row.

## 4. Regions — where shading lives

```
0x40012368(ctx, x1, y1, x2, y2, mode)     dithered rectangle: set / clear / invert
0x40012254(ctx, x1, y1, x2, y2, …)        boxes and lines — 224 callers
```

`0x40012368` normalises the corners (swaps so x1 ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y2, clips to
the surface), builds a per-word column mask from `-1 >> (x1 & 31)` and
`-1 << (31 − (x2 & 31))` (MSB = leftmost pixel), and branches on the
**sign of `mode`**:

| mode | operation | at |
|---|---|---|
| `< 0` | `eor.l` — invert | `0x40012442` |
| `> 0` | `or.l` — set | `0x40012460` |
| `= 0` | `and.l` — clear | `0x4001247a` |

**Every mode is dithered.** 🟡 The per-row loop starts from `0xaaaaaaaa`
(`0x55555555` for clear) and re-applies `not` + `and mask` each row, so the
phase alternates row by row: a true 50% checkerboard, not stripes. There is
no solid-fill path in this routine; solid boxes are `0x40012254`'s.

That is the panel's grey. To grey an area, invert a checkerboard over it
(the arranger's cursor); to light it, OR one; to dim what is already drawn,
AND one — the glyph loses every other lit pixel and the background stays
black. XOR over a black background lights half of it (a grey box).

🟡 **The AND path clears outside its rectangle.** `0x4001246e..0x40012484`
ANDs the surface word with `mask & 0xaaaaaaaa`, where `mask` is the
in-rectangle column mask, so every pixel of the same 32-pixel word that lies
outside the rectangle is cleared too. Whether stock only ever calls mode 0
on word-aligned spans is not checked. An overlay that dims one knob cell
(≈21 px of 128, never word-aligned) cannot use it as-is; a cave-side
`and ~(mask & 0x55555555)` is the fix if the reading holds.

## 4b. The panel link: what the controller sends (18 Sep 2026) ✅ under the port

UART1 (`0xfc064000`, 312,500 baud, ISR `0x400109bc`, `KERNEL.md`) carries
the panel controller's events to the OS. The ISR rings each byte
(`0x46100b28`, 32 deep, count `0x460ffda0`) and forces INTC0 source 37,
whose handler `0x4009228c` parses:

| header | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2n` | 1 byte | key row `n` (0..7): bit `b` = key `n·8 + b` held. The parser XORs against the row's last state (`0x46100b18[n]`) and queues one event per changed bit from the keymap at `[0x46c901dc]` (12-byte records `{01, code, 01, 00, queue, 0}`, the identity map, so **key code = row·8 + bit**; a second table at `+0x302` is selected while the header's FUNCTION row/mask matches — `0xff`/`0x80` in 1.40C, never) |
| `0x3n` | 1 byte | encoder `n`: signed delta (A..F = 0..5, LEVEL = 6); coalesced into a pending event's delta if one is queued |
| `0x40` | 1 byte | the MAIN pot, 0..255, scaled by the calibration at `0x1ffffa..0x1ffffe` (magic `0x1234`) to 0..127 → `0x40092fac` |
| `0x7n` | 9 bytes | copied to `0x46100b48` (pointer `0x46100b52`); the controller's identity 🟡 |

Key events go through `0x40000c3c(queue 0x460d17ae, event)` — 8-byte
records `{code, 0, pressed, 0, ticks}` in the ring at `0x46c9026c` — to
the UI task, which reaches `FUN_4005578c(code, edge)` for a page key and
the key layers `0x46c7d8de + code·0x18`. Keymaps are layers (octalab,
MKI, 13 Sep 2026 ✅): `0x40031494(map)` / `0x4003146c(map)` register /
remove a 20-byte map `{next, keys, encoders, 0, marker}`; rebuild
(`FUN_4003125c`) into keys `0x46c7d8de + code·0x18` and encoders
`0x46c7dede + enc·0x14`; last registered wins; −1 lets the layer below
through; a null encoder handler swallows the turn. The image's keymaps
(section 4c): the MKI layer `0x400c090a` → keys `0x400bfc10` (57 records, no
`0x1c`) and the MKII layer `0x400c091e` → keys `0x400c01f4` (62: the same
57 plus `0x1c..0x1f`, `0x36`); ✅ which one `0x40061bc4` pushes follows
`0x46c8d18c`. (Until 25 Sep 2026 this read "`0x400bfbf6` (59 records)":
`0x400bfbf6` is 0x1a before the table the MKI layer points at, inside the
record before it.) Record, 0x1a bytes: `+0 code, +2 press, +6 release,
+0xa, +0xe sub-map, +0x12, +0x16`; the table ends at a code `0xff`. Double press: `0x400c0aac` last keycode,
`0x460d5de0` ticks (display loop `0x40052204`, reset `0x40033e20`), window
14 ticks. LEVEL press `0x3e` special-cased at `0x4004ecfc`. Popups: yes/no
`0x4006d57c(title, n, lines[], 3, handler)`; scrolling list
`0x4006d94c(count, sel, arg3, labels[], handlers[])` / close `0x4006d754`
/ refresh `0x4006d784`; labels pointer `0x460e5e2c`. Grid recording
`0x460d1736 != 0`; audio editor `0x4006de34(type, slot)` + `0x4006e160()`.
Measured under
the port: `0x24 0x08` (row 4 bit 3 = `0x23`) switched the page kind to 2
and the plane redrew as AMP.

Key codes (octalab's list, plus the probe of 18 Sep 2026 under the
port, each code alone in a fresh session): trigs `0x00..0x0f`, tracks
`0x10..0x17`, PROJ (MKII) `0x1c`, PART `0x1d`, AED `0x1e`, ARR `0x1f`
(section 4c), DOWN `0x20`, RIGHT `0x21`, page keys
`0x22..0x26` (SRC, AMP, LFO, FX1, FX2), STOP `0x27`, PLAY `0x28`, REC
`0x29`, CUE `0x2a`, FUNCTION `0x2d`, PATTERN `0x2e`, BANK `0x2f`, YES `0x31`, NO
`0x32`, UP `0x33`, LEFT `0x34`, MIDI `0x35`, encoder pushes `0x38..0x3d`,
LEVEL push `0x3e`. KEYPROBE ✅ STOP is `0x27`, not `0x2a` as this list
said until 25 Sep 2026: under the port (`--mkii`, bamsep26 +
OCTABAM89_setgate) PLAY `0x28` turned LED row 11 from `0x01` (stop) to
`0x08` (play), `0x2a` left it at `0x08`, `0x27` put it back to `0x01`
(`KEYMAP.md` has 0x24.7 = STOP and 0x25.2 = CUE from route A); in both
keymaps `0x27` has one handler `0x4004aca4` for press and repeat, `0x2a`
a press and a release handler (`0x4004e978`/`0x4004e968`) and a sub-map
(`0x400bf2a0`), the held-modifier shape.

`ot_emu --live FIFO` feeds these bytes from text lines and
`tools/emu/lcd_view.py --panel FIFO` draws a control surface (`tools/emu/README.md`).
What the OS sends BACK on the same link (LEDs, the plane) is unread.

## 4c. The MKII: model flag, panel loader, report, keys (25 Sep 2026) ✅ under the port

What makes the firmware run as an MKII, and what the port (`ot_emu
--mkii`) models so that it does. Read from the image (base `0x40000400`)
and measured on bamsep26 + OCTABAM89_setgate staged as `verify_set.py`
stages it; scratch drivers in `out/_agents/mkii/` (gitignored).

**The model flag `0x46c8d18c`.** The panel-link init at `0x4001f834` sets
it to 1 (`0x4001f8ce`), then ten times writes `0x20` to GPIO
`0xfc0a403a` (bit 5 high), reads bit 6, writes `0xdf` to `0xfc0a4052`
(bit 5 low), reads bit 6; bit 6 not following bit 5 clears the flag
(`0x4001f910`, MKI). ✅ With bit 6 tied to bit 5 (`--mkii`) the flag stays
1. 28 `tstl` sites read it; among them the keymap push
`0x40061bc4`, the loader call `0x4001f976`, the `74 00` / `43` choice
`0x4001f982`, the crossfader poll install `0x4001f9d2` (MKI only:
`0x40010ce8(0x7a12, 0x40092f88 | 0x40092fac)`), the `60 00` at
`0x4001fa08`, the report check `0x40061c94` and the OS-upgrade refusal
`0x4007f87a` (MKII refuses an OS string ≤ `"0155"`, a panel with report
byte 4 = 22 one ≤ `"0177"`).

**The panel loader handshake `0x4001f4dc`** (MKII only; interrupts off,
polled on `0xfc064004` bit 0 / `0xfc06400c`): send `60 02 70 00`, read 5
bytes. `70 05 v ..` with `v` = the long at `0x400d81a4` (8 in 1.40C) →
send `60 00`, return 0. `70 05` with another `v` → reflash the panel from
the image at `0x400d81a8..0x400db3d4` (erase `80 42`, five `ff` back, then
5-byte `cmd addr32` writes echoed by the panel through `0x4001f40c`, up to
3 tries), return `v`. Any other reply → `60 00`, return −1. ✅ With nothing
answering, the port's TX stream stopped at `60 02 70 00` and the boot sat
in the polled read `0x4001f540` (interrupts off) until the first bytes
arrived on the panel line. Inferred from that: in the WIP port the first
key report was taken as the loader's reply (return −1), which is why the
boot then continued, the `74 00` went unanswered and "UI NOT TESTED!"
appeared.

**The report.** On an MKII the CPU sends `74 00` (`0x4001f98a`) where an
MKI gets `43`. The RX parser `0x4009228c` has one format for both models
(no reference to `0x46c8d18c`): header `0x7n` + 9 bytes → `0x46100b48`,
pointer `0x46100b52`. Readers: `0x40061c94` (byte 3 == 0 → "UI NOT
TESTED!" `0x400b4e17`; byte 4 == 22 → `0x46c8d188` = 1) and the system
page `0x400698a6` ("UI VERSION" `1.<byte 1>.<byte 4 == 22>`, format
`0x400b64e7`).

**What the port answers** (`ot::MkiiPanel`, `tools/emu/ot_emu/periph.h`,
on the far end of `Uart@fc064000`, the TX stream framed by the
section 9 opcode lengths): `60 02` enters the loader state, `70 00`
there gets `70 05 v 00 00` with `v` read from the image, `60 00` leaves
it; `74 00` gets `70 00 v 00 01 00 00 00 00 00` (byte 1 = `v`, byte 3 = 1
tested, byte 4 = 0). 🟡 The report's values other than byte 3 are chosen,
not captured from an MKII panel. ✅ Measured order: loader entered at
instruction 10,198,954, returned 0 at 10,199,051, report parsed
(`0x40092608`) at 10,199,687, checked (`0x40061c94`) at 45,935,951;
`0x40061cbc` ("UI NOT TESTED!") never runs; `0x46100b48` =
`00 08 00 01 00 00 00 00 00`, `0x46c8d188` = 0.

**Keys.** The MKII panel's key, encoder and crossfader reports are the
MKI's `0x2r` / `0x3r` / `0x40` (the parser has one format), so the key
code is still `row·8 + bit`. What differs is the UI layer: the MKII key
table `0x400c01f4` = the MKI's `0x400bfc10` + five records:

| code | matrix | handler | measured under `--mkii` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x1c` | `0x23` bit 4 | `0x40064d78` | PROJ: the PROJECT menu (PROJECT / SYSTEM / CONTROL / MIDI) |
| `0x1d` | `0x23` bit 5 | `0x4002e7c8` | PART: the part chooser (ONE / TWO / THREE / FOUR) |
| `0x1e` | `0x23` bit 6 | `0x4006e274` | AED: the audio editor (`STATIC 001`, TRIM SLICE EDIT ATTR FILE) |
| `0x1f` | `0x23` bit 7 | `0x40058ab8` | ARR: the arranger menu (`ARR 1:` EDIT RENAME CHANGE CHAIN CLEAR SAVE RELOAD) |
| `0x36` | `0x26` bit 6 | `0x40030a6c` | REC3 🟡: beside REC AB `0x2b` (`0x40030e6c`) and REC CD `0x2c` (`0x40030c60`), same sub-map `0x400b9e02`; nothing drawn on a STATIC track |

PAGE is code `0x1b` (`0x23` bit 3), the MKI's SCALE key: the same handler
`0x4004ffc4` in both tables. ✅ FUNC + `0x1b` under `--mkii` draws
`SCALE, TRACK 3 64/64` (per-track scale). Every tap above hits the key
dispatcher `0x40031904` once (press) and the key-row path `0x400923c0`
twice (press, release), in both models; under MKI the same `0x23.4-7`
taps draw nothing (the MKI table has no record for them). Also measured
under `--mkii`: YES on the date prompt (`DATE/TIME STORED`), T2 then T1
(`0x80000000` 1 → 0), knob A +3 on T3's SRC page (`0x40170fc6` and
`0x800008a0` 64 → 66, PTCH draws `+0.4`), code `0x27` = STOP (above).

**LCD and LEDs under `--mkii`** ✅: the stream decodes with
`panel_link.PanelLink` as on an MKI (897 LCD blocks, 81 LED rows, 785 LED
levels after boot + 500 ms); new on the wire: `60 02 70 00`, `74 00`,
`60 00`, and 204 `0xb5` messages (`0x4003f430` called from
`0x40061af2` / `0x40061b22` only when the flag is set).

Where it is wired (the panel, `live.py`, the gates): `tools/panel/README.md`.

## 5. The cursor idiom — and the arranger's giant one

A screen highlights a cell by looking up its geometry in a per-type table
and inverting a rectangle around it. The arranger's (`0x40049896`):

```
a0 = x[type][column]            ; 0x400a775e
a1 = w[type][column]            ; 0x400a783c
pea -1                          ; mode: EOR
pea (1,%a0,%a1)                 ; x2 = x + w + 1
a0 = a0 - 1 - a1                ; x1 = x - w - 1
jsr 0x40012254
```

✅ **Those tables are (centre, half-width)**, not (left, width): the
arithmetic is symmetric about `x`, and a pattern row's column 0 (centre 12,
half 5 → 6..18) is a three-digit row number's span.

A REMINDER row appears to grey out when the cursor reaches its text column
because that cell is centre 82, half-width **38**: the inverted checkerboard
is 78 pixels of a 128-pixel line, against under 20 for every other cell on
every row type. Nothing is dimmed; XOR-ing a checkerboard over lit pixels
turns half of them off.

## 6. Greying a blanked parameter slot — what is still missing

A nibble-0 slot (`PARAM_PAGES.md` section 3b) draws an empty circle and `---` on
the unit (our image, 16 Sep 2026). To dim it with section 4 the following are
unread:

- which drawer puts the circle and `---` there and its per-slot geometry
  (x1, y1, x2, y2 for slots 0–5, pages 1 and 2). Candidates: the knob
  renderer `0x400479b4` and the list drawer `FUN_40037590` that calls it
  (section 3b's bit-2 reading), neither traced past the flags word;
- a hook site after the page draw and before the plane goes out over
  UART1 (the sender is unlocated), on every refresh; a one-shot overlay
  is redrawn away;
- a per-slot flag: every nibble bit is in use (section 3b: bit 1 = link bracket,
  bit 2 = the PLAYBACK page-2 layout flag, bit 3 = the scene-held XVOL);
- the cell geometry is a framebuffer read now: `ot_emu --lcd --live`
  with the page keys (section 4b) leaves a run on any page.

## 7. Not known

- `+20` / `+24` of the surface descriptor, and what `+16` (all `0xff`
  after a load) is for;
- how the two bits per pixel are composed for the display — every drawer
  here is 1-bit-per-pixel into one buffer, so the second bit comes from
  somewhere not yet found — and the UART1 sender;
- the window/geometry descriptor internals `MAINMENU.md` lists, a layer
  above these primitives.

## 8. Timers, LEDs and the UI tick (measured under the port, Tim Hastie, 12 Sep 2026)

From the panel work; the investigation logs are
`git show f5148320:tools/panel/KEYMAP.md` (the 12 Sep sections).

- **The OS image loads at `0x40000400`.** The file's offset `0x13220` is RAM
  `0x40013620`; a static scan adds 0x400 to file offsets and nothing to
  absolute operands.
- **The DMA timers.** DTIM0..3 at `0xfc070000 + 0x4000*n`, INTC0 sources
  32+n, clocked from the 132 MHz internal bus:
  - DTIM1: DTRR 68750, DTMR 0x1d = 8.333 ms, 120 Hz. Its handler
    `0x40055cb8` (vector 0x61) signals `0x46c7e0e2`, which the LED/key-scan
    task at `0x4005593c` pends on, and on every second tick posts `0x01` to
    the UI queue `0x460d1664` and `0x05` to sys: the firmware's 60 Hz UI and
    sys ticks.
  - DTIM2: DTMR 0x13, DTRR 132,000,000, free-run: the one-second idle poll
    of the MIDI note-length scheduler `0x400409f4`.
  - DTIM3: DTMR 0x0b, bus/1, no interrupt: a free-running timestamp. The
    boot logo loops until `int(DTCN3 / 660000.0) > 559` (2.8 s).
  - DTIM0: DTMR 7 = the DTIN0 pin: the MIDI RX ISR timestamps 0xF8 with it
    (`0x4001070a`).
- **LEDs are countdowns.** `set_led(id, n)` (`0x40013784`) writes n into a
  per-id countdown (`0x460ba9cc`, 136 longs), sets the bit in `0x460ba9ae`
  and flushes; `set_led_timed` (`0x400136f4`) adds instead. `0x4001387c`
  decrements every 120 Hz tick and clears the bit at zero. The beat LED is
  `set_led(38, 3)` from `0x40056f2a`, once per beat.
- **The trig-LED running light follows the UI's current track.** The pass
  `0x40043fdc` clears ids 0..31 and draws one pair for the track at
  `0x80000000` (+8 on the MIDI side), if `0x4009b290(track)` says running.
- **PLAYS FREE is the pattern byte `+0x54` per track** (`0x400e2234 +
  2330*t`). FW_TRANSPORT(0) (`0x4009b964`, the PLAY key's path) sets a track
  up only if it is zero; FW_START_TRACK(t) (`0x4009b5c8`, the trig-key
  start) acts only if it is set. Its UI writer is an encoder toggle for the
  current track (`0x400824fe`).
- **The popup slot `0x460d175c`** names the open popup record
  (`0x46c7d34c` for every popup the panel opens), a geometry: +0x08 x0,
  +0x0c y0, +0x18 x1, +0x20 flags (0x21 open, 0x01 closed), +0x28 rows. The
  page SETUP windows share x 7..0xf4, y 0, 0x40 rows; the PROJECT menu is
  5..0xf6, the MIXER 10..0xec, TEMPO 0x1c..0xca.
- **The boot mounts the last set.** The sys tick's startup step
  (`0x40052200` .. `0x4007ec5a`) reads the set name at `0x100f8480` after
  the media case; empty, it opens `NO SET IS MOUNTED!` over SET DATE/TIME.

## 9. The CPU → front-panel link (UART@fc064000), in detail

What the MAIN OS sends to the panel microcontroller, decoded far enough to
draw the LCD and the LEDs from the byte stream alone. Decoder:
`tools/panel/panel_link.py` (`PanelLink`, pure stdlib). Read 11 Sep 2026
from `out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin`; measured against route-A captures
(`rt.uart64.tx`) of a boot on an empty card, MIXER open/close, an encoder
turn, PATTERN SETTINGS, cursor-right, a trig key and a track key.

### Image base, first

The file loads at **0x40000400** (`emu_bringup.BASE`, a 0x400 header), so
`m68k-elf-objdump ... --adjust-vma=0x40000400` is the listing whose
addresses match the firmware's own `jsr` operands; every address in this
file is from that listing. With `--adjust-vma=0x40000000` the same code
sits 0x400 lower and every routine below lands mid-instruction (0x40010b1c
is then inside a `clrl`), which is how the earlier "0x10 <chunk>" reading
went wrong. (Until 11 Sep 2026 the producers table below quoted the ring
writer / byte pusher / drain as 0x4001071c / 0x400106a4 / 0x4001064c: those
are the 0x40000000-listing addresses of the same three routines, 0x400 low;
in the 0x40000400 listing the first two are mid-instruction and the third
is an unreferenced `bgtw`.)

### Producers: every path onto the wire

All traffic on the panel UART comes from six places (reference counts are
`grep -cE '0x4001....\b'` over the 0x40000400 listing):

| routine | what |
|---|---|
| `0x40010b1c` ring writer `(len, ptr)` | `moveal %sp@(16),%a2`, spins while the ring count `[0x400b96cc]` > 2046, pushes `len` bytes into the 2 KB ring at `[0x400b96bc]`, arms the TX interrupt (`UIMR := 3`). 5 references: `0x40013a6e` (clear), `0x40013d20` (flush), `0x4001f99e`, `0x4001fa1c`, `0x400926c6` |
| `0x40010aa4` byte pusher `(byte)` | one byte, same ring. 12 references; every builder loads it with `lea 0x40010aa4,%aN` and `jsr %aN@` |
| `0x40010a4c` polled drain | spins on TXRDY (`0xfc064004`) and empties the ring. 9 references: boot LED animation `0x4006308a`/`0x40063102`/`0x40063186`/`0x400633bc`, `0x4000fa86`, `0x4007fcfc`-`0x40080152` |
| `0x400109bc` UART1 ISR | drains the ring on TX-ready, hands RX bytes to `[0x460ba980]` |
| `0x4001f40c`, `0x4001f4dc` | boot-time polled handshake, direct `UTB` writes; the MKII panel loader (flag `0x46c8d18c`, `docs/firmware/PANEL.md` section 4c), taken under `ot_emu --mkii` |

Every message builder takes the mutex `0x400b96f4` (`0x40010db0` lock,
`0x40010d90` unlock) around its pushes, so messages never interleave: the
first byte of a message decides its length and nothing else is needed to
frame the stream.

### Opcode table (first byte -> length)

| first byte | len | builder | message |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x10`-`0x17` | 10 | `0x40013abc` diff flush, `0x40013a24` clear | **LCD block**: `page = op & 7`, then the column start (only 0, 8, ..., 120: both builders step it by 8 to 128, `0x40013a92`/`0x40013d38`), then 8 column bytes (columns `col..col+7` of that page) |
| `0x20`-`0x2f` | 2 | `0x40013634`, `0x40062fec`, `0x400631fc` init | **LED bitmap row** `op & 0xf`, one byte of on/off bits (bit n = LED `row*8+n`) |
| `0xa0`-`0xaf` | 2 | `0x40013634` | LED bitmap row `16 + (op & 0xf)` (17 rows = 136 LEDs; the state array is `0x460ba9ae` XOR the blink phase `0x460ba98c`) |
| `0x30`-`0x3f` | 2 | `0x400135b0` (cache `0x400b9714`), `0x4006322c` init | **LED level**: nibble `op & 0xf`, then the LED id. Init sends `3f 00 .. 3f 57` (88 ids at 15) |
| `0x40`-`0x4f` | 1 | `0x400926d8` | one-byte command `0x40 | (n & 0xf)`; boot sends `0x43` (`0x4001f9ac`) |
| `0x60`, `0x70`, `0x74` | 2 | `0x4001f4dc`, `0x4001fa08`, `0x4001f98a` | MKII only (flag `0x46c8d18c`): `60 02 70 00` the loader query (reply `70 05 <version> ..`, polled), `60 00` leave the loader, `74 00` ask for the `0x7r` report (PANEL.md section 4c) |
| `0xb5` | 6 | `0x40013368` via `0x400133cc` | 16-bit index (`2*a+b`), then three bytes; sent when the LED brightness setting changes (`0x4003f430`). Palette/brightness table entry -- inferred from the caller, not measured |
| `0xb7` | 2 | `0x400926a8` | LCD backlight 0-255 (`0x4003f430` from the table at `0x400a7632`; the screen saver at `0x400523da` sends 0 and clears the LCD after 216000 ticks) |

Anything else is unknown: `PanelLink` skips one byte, counts it in
`stats["unknown"]`, keeps the last 16 in `unknown_tail`, and carries on; a
`0x1n` whose column byte is not one of 0, 8, .., 120 is skipped the same
way (also counted in `stats["lcd_badcol"]`). None occurred in 9429
captured bytes (1367 messages, 837 LCD blocks) or in the self-test's boot +
MIXER stream (6861 B).

Resync is by first byte only -- no length field, no checksum -- so what
junk does depends on whether it looks like an opcode (measured 11 Sep 2026
with `out/_agents/lcd/verify_fix.py`, junk inserted at the last message
boundary of the 9429-byte capture, offset 9419):

- not an opcode (`ff fe 00`, `99`, `50..5f`): skipped a byte at a time;
  final frame, LEDs and commands identical to the clean stream;
- a `0x1n` with a bad column byte (`12 03`): rejected, identical;
- a `0x1n` with a valid column byte (`10 00`, `17 78`): framed as an LCD
  block and eats the next 8 bytes (here the head of the last real block: 23
  / 19 pixels wrong, the 2 leftover bytes skipped as unknown). Because the
  firmware's flush is a diff, a misframed block stays on the decoded screen
  until the firmware next redraws it; the same junk inserted mid-stream
  (offset 3413, before the post-boot full draw) left no trace;
- a bare `3f`: takes the next byte as an LED id, then the block is misread
  (7 pixels wrong the same way).

What the naive pair parser saw: `00 ff`, `00 00`, `80 be`, `8a be` were LCD
column bytes; `0x11 08` is page 1, column 8; the "chunks 247/248" were LCD
bytes read as an opcode; the "id 0x00-0x5b, value 0x3f" pairs are really
`3f <id>` (level 15, ids 0-0x57) read one byte late after the bare `0x43`.

### LCD geometry (measured)

128x64, eight pages of 128 column bytes, exactly what the two builders walk
(`for page in 0..7: for col in 0,8,..,120`, column-major back buffers at
`[0x400b9710]`/`[0x400b970c]`, swapped after each flush). The panel shows
message **page p at screen rows `8*(7-p) .. 8*(7-p)+7`, bit 0 at the top of
the band**: page 7 is the top of the screen.

    pixel(x, y) = frame[(7 - y//8) * 128 + x] >> (y & 7) & 1

Evidence, from the decoded stream (PNGs `out/_agents/lcd/selftest_*.png`,
`mixer-open_B.png`, `boot+400ms_B.png`, `pattern-settings_B.png`):

- MIXER: inverted "MIXER" title bar rows 0-8, then MIX / OUT / MAIN / CUE /
  DIR / GAIN A B, C D, then "MUTE", "AUDIO" / "MIDI" with the 8+8 mute
  boxes along the bottom. With page 0 on top the same bytes put the title
  at rows 55-63 and the section headers under their contents.
- SET DATE/TIME: bar at rows 8-16, "FRIDAY", the RTC date/time, "LAST SET:"
  above its value `0000-00-00 00:00:00`; the main screen's "PLAYBACK>STATIC
  ... 01->09" bar along rows 57-63 and the BPM "120.0" top-left.
- PATTERN SETTINGS: "SELECT PATTERN" window, "A01", same footer.

There is no display-start-line / scroll opcode in the table, so the page
order on screen is fixed; the "rotated" renders from RAM at `0x460d1f80`
are that buffer's problem (it is not one of the two UART back buffers),
not the panel's. The stream is the ground truth.

Bit order within a page byte is the same as `panel_server.FB`'s formula
(`buf[x*8 + (63-y)//8]` bit `7-(63-y)%8` == page `7-y//8`, bit `y&7`).

### Traffic per action (empty card, stock image)

| action | bytes | messages |
|---|---|---|
| boot + 400 ms | 5731 | `43`; 440 LED levels; 470 LCD blocks (full frame plus redraws); 76 LED rows |
| MIXER down | 1130 | 112 LCD blocks; `20 55`, `21 55`, `22 ff`, `23 ff`, `3f 66` |
| encoder row 0x30, +2 | 22 | 2 LCD blocks; `2c 40` |
| MIXER again (close) | 1130 | 112 LCD blocks; rows 0-3 and 0x2c back to 0 |
| PATTERN SETTINGS | 522 | 52 LCD blocks; `20 01` |
| cursor-right | 120 | 12 LCD blocks |
| trig 1 down / up | 520 / 2 | 52 LCD blocks / `20 00` |
| track 2 | 72 | 7 LCD blocks; `25 a6` |

A quiet screen sends nothing (0 bytes over 500 ms idle): the flush is a
diff against the previous frame, block by block.

### Self-test

    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_link.py --selftest      # 15-20 s wall, exit 0

Boots the stock image on an empty card (the boot is most of the wall time:
15.4 s and 17.1 s measured 11 Sep 2026), feeds the stream in 7-byte
pieces, opens MIXER, and asserts: no unknown bytes, nothing left unframed,
the `0x43` hello and 88 LED levels at init, the MIXER title bar in rows 0-8
and nothing inverted in the bottom band, the boot footer bar ending on row
63 and the dialog bar in rows 8-16, and that the whole stream fed in one
call decodes to the same frame / LEDs / commands / stats as the 7-byte
pieces. It writes `selftest_boot.png` and `selftest_mixer.png` under
`--out` (default `out/_agents/lcd/`).

### Panel -> CPU: the RX parser (13 Sep 2026)

`0x4009228c` (RAM, 0x40000400 listing) runs on the UART's receive
interrupt over the ring at `0x46100b28` (`0x40092254` fills it). The FIRST
byte of a report decides its class by its high nibble and its payload
length; the low nibble is the row:

| first byte | payload | class |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2r` | 1 byte | **key matrix row r**, bitmask (set = held); changed bits against the last mask (`0x46100b18[r]`) become key events from the descriptor table at `[0x46c901dc] + (r*8+bit)*12` (+770 with the modifier row's key held -- never: the table's modifier row is 0xff), posted to the UI/sys queues. Rows 0-7 are all live entries (key codes 0x00-0x3f); **row 7 (`0x27`) is the encoders' push switches**, bit = the encoder (A-F = 0-5, LEVEL = 6): with a TRIG key held it toggles the step's parameter lock (KEYMAP.md, 13 Sep 2026) |
| `0x3r` | 1 byte | **encoder r**, signed detent delta; if the previous report is still unread it is ADDED into the pending message (`0x4009250c`), else a 6-byte message `{type, sub, delta, stamp}` is posted (`0x40092526`) |
| `0x40` | 1 byte | **the crossfader**: the ADC byte 0..255. Scaled by the calibration record at `0x1ffffe` (magic `0x1234`: min `[0x1ffffc]+1`, span from `[0x1ffffa]`, `0x400925ac`), none under emulation so `pos = (byte >> 1) & 127`; `0x40092fac` drops a repeat of the last value (`0x400d16cc`) and `0x40092f2c` writes it into a 2-byte ping-pong message `04 <pos>` at `0x400d16c8/ca` (coalesced while one is pending) and posts it to the sys queue registered in `0x46104ca4`. Sys kind 4 -> `0x40061e0a`: gated on AUDIO CC OUT having INT (`0x8000004a` bit 0), stores `0x460d16c8`, rebuilds the 10 weight longs `0x80003c60`, echoes CC 48 = 127-pos if EXT, runs the STRT/LEN/RATE morph `0x4003f1b4` and redraws the fader icon (`0x4003577c`, five glyphs from `0x400bcd7c`, LCD x 104-108 / y 59-61). Rows `0x41`-`0x4f` are ignored (`0x4009256a` wants row 0) |
| `0x7r` | 9 bytes | a report copied to `0x46100b48` with its pointer in `0x46100b52`: the MKII panel's answer to `74 00` (byte 1 = UI version minor, byte 3 = UI tested, byte 4 == 22 sets `0x46c8d188`); `ot_emu --mkii` sends one (`docs/firmware/PANEL.md` section 4c) |
| anything else | -- | the parser stays in its header state |

Measured on the port (`out/_agents/panel-ctl/lab_params.py`, OTLIVE):
`0x40 255` -> `0x460d16c8` = 127, `0x40 0` -> 0, `128` -> 64, `64` -> 32,
`192` -> 96, `1` -> 0, `254` -> 127, `127` -> 63, `200` -> 100; each one
redraws the icon and rebuilds the weights (`0x80003c60` = `0x8000_0000` at
127 = scene A fully, `0x0000_8000` at 0 = scene B). Rows `0x27`-`0x2f`,
`0x37`-`0x3f`, `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x4f` with a value byte change nothing
(`0x27`/`0x37` nudge the tempo readout's redraw, as KEYMAP.md found for
`0x27`) -- alone: `0x27` with a TRIG key held is the encoder push, the
lock toggle (KEYMAP.md, 13 Sep 2026). The panel's own scaling of the pot to `0x40 <byte>` on the
hardware is not measured here (no unit); the message and the firmware's
side are.

### Not yet known

- The meaning of the `0xb5` five bytes and of `0x4n` for n != 3 (`60 xx`,
  `70 00`, `74 00` are the MKII's: `docs/firmware/PANEL.md` section 4c).
- Which physical LED each bitmap bit and each level id is (the boot
  animation at `0x4006307c`-`0x40063178` walks ids 0-15 with levels
  14-30, a starting point for a map).
- The `0x7r` report's bytes other than 1, 3 and 4 (no MKII panel capture)
  and the encoder message's type/sub bytes per row (the descriptor table at
  `[0x46c901dc]`); keys, encoders and the crossfader are decoded above.
