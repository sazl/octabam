# Documentation

Where each doc is, by who reads it. A module's own page is
`modules/<name>/README.md`, a remix's `remixes/<name>/README.md`, a tool's
`tools/<dir>/README.md`.

## Building and flashing a remix

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [guide/BUILDING.md](guide/BUILDING.md) | what to install (macOS, Linux/WSL2), the toolchain, your own OS 1.40C, building an image, flashing from the card or over MIDI, after the flash, recovery, back to stock |
| [../remixes/README.md](../remixes/README.md) | the remixes you can flash, with where each has run |
| [guide/REMIXER.md](guide/REMIXER.md) | composing your own remix: the `make remix` TUI, or a `remix.py` by hand |
| [guide/USB_PANEL_MIRROR.md](guide/USB_PANEL_MIRROR.md) | experimental physical USB panel viewer: safe host setup, identity, read-only limits and recovery |

## Writing a module or changing the build

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | the contract: the one rule, your first PR, the oracle rule, the gates before a PR |
| [contributing/MODULES.md](contributing/MODULES.md) | writing a module: manifests, descriptors, DSP and ColdFire declarations, the ledger |
| [contributing/PLACEMENT.md](contributing/PLACEMENT.md) | where a module's code goes and what is free, measured |
| [contributing/TESTING.md](contributing/TESTING.md) | every gate, what it proves and cannot see; `make check`, `make reach`, shards, `make accept`, bit-identity, CI |
| [contributing/TOOLING.md](contributing/TOOLING.md) | every tool by pipeline stage, and which README each tool directory has |
| [contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md](contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md) | what has gone wrong on a unit: symptom, cause, fix, the gate that catches it |
| [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) | working rules and the traps that have cost real work (for people and coding agents) |

## The tools

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [../tools/remix/README.md](../tools/remix/README.md) | the remix engine: schema, registry, ledger, the DRAM platform, the remixer's internals |
| [../tools/harness/README.md](../tools/harness/README.md) | hearing and measuring the DSP side locally: `dsp_host`, `send_probe`, `rig_render`, `pressure`, the stress project |
| [../tools/emu/README.md](../tools/emu/README.md) | the ColdFire emulators: the port (`ot_emu`) and Tier-0 (Unicorn) |
| [../tools/panel/README.md](../tools/panel/README.md) | the virtual front panel over the port; [KEYMAP.md](../tools/panel/KEYMAP.md) the key and LED map |
| [../tools/ghidra/README.md](../tools/ghidra/README.md) | the Ghidra project over the OS and both DSP payloads |

## The firmware, reverse-engineered

[firmware/USB_PANEL_MIRROR.md](firmware/USB_PANEL_MIRROR.md) records the
accepted-wire observer, corrected boot boundary, protocol, publication and
the distinction between port evidence and unmeasured hardware budgets.

[firmware/](firmware/): OS 1.40C as measured here. Start at
[ARCHITECTURE.md](firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md); [CHIP.md](firmware/CHIP.md)
is the silicon and the cycle budget, [DSP.md](firmware/DSP.md) the audio
DSP, and the rest one subsystem each (kernel, tables, parameter pages,
menus, panel, MIDI, LFO, level law, recorder, sample save, storage,
Parts and pattern changes in [PARTS.md](firmware/PARTS.md), step locks, the ColdFire delay routine in [COLDFIRE_DELAY.md](firmware/COLDFIRE_DELAY.md),
REPITCH in [REPITCH.md](firmware/REPITCH.md)).

## Proposals

[proposals/](proposals/): two OTX documents, a shared settings store for
modules (draft, not implemented): [OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md](proposals/OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md)
and [OTX_MODULE_GUIDELINES.md](proposals/OTX_MODULE_GUIDELINES.md).

## History

[../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) has one entry per image that reached a
unit. Records that were closed and removed are cited in place as
`git show <sha>:<path>`.

## USB panel input development

[Input mirroring design](superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-usb-panel-input-design.md)
and [implementation plan](superpowers/plans/2026-10-08-usb-panel-input.md)
record the schema-2 physical control extension and its verification scope.
