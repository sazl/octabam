# octabam

[![CI](https://github.com/sambanks/octabam/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sambanks/octabam/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An unofficial community remixer for the Elektron Octatrack's operating
system, not affiliated with Elektron: pick the modifications you want and
build them into one firmware image from your own copy of OS 1.40C.

A modification is a **module** (`modules/<name>/`). A named selection of
modules is a **remix** (`remixes/<name>/`). `make image REMIX=<name>`
composes a remix into a card-flashable image: it places the code, wires
the hooks by symbol, refuses collisions by name, and proves every ported
module against its author's own build byte for byte. No firmware is
distributed here; every image is derived from the user's own 1.40C on the
user's machine, and a built image must never be shared.

Every module is contributed by its author and credited in the table below.
Pull requests are accepted: a module, a port of an existing mod, a fix, a
doc correction. Issues are disabled and there is no request queue. The
licence is MIT; a fork that takes requests and tracks issues is allowed.

## Start here

| you want to | read |
|---|---|
| put a remix on your Octatrack | [docs/guide/BUILDING.md](docs/guide/BUILDING.md): a fresh machine to a flashed unit, step by step, with the recovery path |
| see what remixes exist and what is in each | [remixes/README.md](remixes/README.md), then the remix's own page in `remixes/<name>/README.md` |
| see every module and how far it is proven | the table below; each module's `modules/<name>/README.md` has the measurements |
| compose your own selection | [docs/guide/REMIXER.md](docs/guide/REMIXER.md): `make remix`, the interactive remixer, or a `remix.py` by hand |
| write a module or port an existing mod | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (the contract), [docs/contributing/MODULES.md](docs/contributing/MODULES.md) (the guide), [docs/contributing/TESTING.md](docs/contributing/TESTING.md) (what the gates prove) |
| understand the firmware | [docs/firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md) and its neighbours; [docs/contributing/TOOLING.md](docs/contributing/TOOLING.md) for the tools |
| find any other doc | [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) |

## Quick start

[docs/guide/BUILDING.md](docs/guide/BUILDING.md) has every step. Section 0 is what
to install first: on macOS the Xcode Command Line Tools
(`xcode-select --install`), Homebrew, Python 3.10+ and
`brew install cmake uv`. Then `make setup`, `make emu-setup`,
`make os && make recon`, `make image REMIX=<name> BUILD=1`, and the flash
from the card (section 5).

## How it works

```
modules/<name>/manifest.py   what a module is and what it claims (yours, or a pointer into an author's repo)
remixes/<name>/remix.py      which modules, in which chooser order; README.md beside it
remixes/test/<name>/         a remix of one module, for that module's gates
tools/remix/ledger.py        refuses two modules that claim one address, hook, id or buffer, by name
tools/build/build_bus.py     the build: assembles, links, places, wires, verifies -> out/mainos_bus.bin
tools/verify/*               the gates: oracles, the boot under the ColdFire port, menu, cycles, identity
```

A module's code lands in one of two places; the build decides which bytes
go where, and a module declares what it is, not an address:

| class | declared as | where |
|---|---|---|
| ROM cave | `CavePatch`: a `.s` source, or ratified hex | one of the OS image's free zero runs, ~8 KB total shared by everyone |
| DRAM unit | `Linked(..., dram=True)`: a GNU-as unit | linked with every other DRAM unit in the remix into one runtime, packed, appended behind octabam's loader, depacked at boot into a 10 MB reserve carved off stock's 85.5 MB sample/recorder pool |

The OS-image edits every class needs (a detour at a stock instruction, a
poke, a grown table) are `Detour`, `Poke`, `TableGrow`, wired by symbol and
asserted against stock before a byte is written. `docs/contributing/PLACEMENT.md`
is the map of what is free and what was measured.

**A port is a proof.** The build re-links every unit at the author's own
address and compares, and refuses on any drift.

**Where a module's state lives.** An effect's twelve knobs are Part
parameters and stay in the Part. Personal material (KITS's library,
octalab's grooves) is in files the module owns and formats. A module's
settings (menu options, a USB profile) have no shared home yet; the shared
settings store for all modules, OTX, is specified in
[docs/proposals/OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md](docs/proposals/OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md)
(nordseele, draft 2, 26 Sep 2026) with author-facing
[guidelines](docs/proposals/OTX_MODULE_GUIDELINES.md), and is not implemented.

## Checking without a flash

Everything is checked on your machine against your own 1.40C
([docs/contributing/TESTING.md](docs/contributing/TESTING.md)). The DSP side renders
locally on the assembled instruction stream (`make render`, `make render-rig`;
[tools/harness/README.md](tools/harness/README.md)). The whole machine, the
ColdFire, both DSP cores, the card, the panel, MIDI and USB, runs under a
port of it (`tools/emu/ot_emu`, `make emu-cf`; [tools/emu/README.md](tools/emu/README.md)):

```bash
make check REMIX=<name>             # build + every gate + boot under the port; OT_PROJECT=<dir> adds a real project
make reach                          # the gates this branch's diff reaches, in order; RUN=1 runs them
make panel REMIX=<name>             # the virtual front panel with sound at localhost:8563 (tools/panel/README.md)
make emu-live REMIX=<name>          # the screen and keys in a window, no sound
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `make ci`) runs the checks that need no
firmware. What the emulators cannot see (caches, the recorder's DMA,
cross-core timing) is listed beside every gate that is blind to it.

## Before you flash anything

**Writing a non-official OS to an Octatrack can leave it unusable and puts
your warranty in question.** Nothing here is endorsed by, supported by, or
affiliated with Elektron. [BUILDING.md](docs/guide/BUILDING.md) has the
recovery path (section 7).

**No Elektron binary is redistributed here, and none may be.** A built
`.bin` or `.syx` contains Elektron's OS: do not share built images. Share
the repo; everyone builds their own.

*Octatrack* and *Elektron* are trademarks of Elektron Music Machines MAV
AB, used here only to identify the hardware this project targets.

## Documentation

[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) lists every doc by who it is for. Each
module's page is `modules/<name>/README.md`, each remix's
`remixes/<name>/README.md`, and each tool's `tools/<dir>/README.md`.

## Credit

**Em** ([emuyia](https://github.com/emuyia)) designed Octakit and the
loader-appended DRAM runtime octabam adopted as its large-payload placement;
`tools/remix/loader.S` and the payload packer (`tools/remix/pack.py`) are
derived from hers with attribution. Octakit was carried here as a
submodule until 6 Oct 2026; KITS (`modules/kits`) follows its key map and
reads its `kits3a/b.work` files.

This began as a fork of [mxldyn/octamax](https://github.com/mxldyn/octamax)
by Maxolydian, whose reverse engineering of the OS format, memory map and
parameter tables made any of this reachable; the upstream history is in
this repository's log.

`vendor/` pulls in [dsp56300](https://github.com/dsp56300/dsp56300),
[mc68k](https://github.com/joelanders/mc68k-md-mm) and
[elektron-firmware-tool](https://github.com/mischa85/elektron-firmware-tool).
